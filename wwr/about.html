            <h2 class="titulo2">History</h2>
            <div class="meiuca">
                <p>White water rafting has a rich history that dates back to the early 19th century. Originally
                    developed as a mode of transportation for exploring rugged river terrains, rafting evolved into an
                    adventurous recreational activity over the years. John Wesley Powell, an American explorer, was one
                    of the first to document white water rafting in 1869 during his famous expedition down the Colorado
                    River through the Grand Canyon. His journey marked the beginning of rafting as a way to discover
                    untamed rivers. By the mid-20th century, the sport gained popularity among thrill-seekers and nature
                    enthusiasts alike. Commercial rafting companies began to emerge, offering guided trips through some
                    of the most challenging and scenic rivers in the world. Today, rafting has become a global adventure
                    sport, attracting millions of people every year who are eager to experience the rush of navigating
                    rapids, all while connecting with nature. With advancements in safety and equipment, rafting has
                    evolved into a safe yet exhilarating experience for adventurers of all skill levels, continuing to
                    build on its legacy as one of the most exciting outdoor sports in the world.</p>
                <img class="middleimg" src="images/herocerto.jpg" alt="peoplewater">
